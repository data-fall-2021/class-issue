  <p>The West Village has become a hotspot for COVID-19 cases despite historically having lower infection rates. The area’s restaurant and bar scene may be the cause of the surge this month that has exceeded past case rates. </p>
  <p>Recent data from the NYC Department of Health and Hygiene indicates that the West Village and nearby Greenwich Village are leading the surge. The neighborhood in downtown Manhattan is seeing a case rate of 11,237 per 100,000 New Yorkers, higher than Manhattan’s rate of 9,531.</p>

  <p>This marks the first cold weather season, where the village’s popular bar and restaurants will operate at full capacity, with no mask mandate in place, since the pandemic began. The renewed nightlife appears to be taking a toll on Manhattan’s lower west side.</p>
  <p> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/16/dining/nyc-restaurants-covid-omicron.html">Temperance Wine Bar</a> in the West Village was forced to temporarily close this week due to staff shortages caused by COVID-19 infections amongst their staff members, despite rigorous health protocols. Other restaurants – like <a href="https://ny.eater.com/2021/12/15/22838282/nyc-restaurants-close-temporarily-coronavirus-exposure-omicron-variant">Contento</a> Restaurant on East 111th Street – and local food businesses across the city are experiencing the same temporary shutdowns, in light of the sudden uptick in positive COVID-19 cases. </p>
  <p>According to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/10/nyregion/singing-pandemic-new-york.html">New York Times,</a> some singalong establishments have also started to reopen in the West Village. And the latest data from New York University, which has its main campus in the West Village, shows positive COVID-19 cases for students, faculty and employees for the last week were at their highest since early September.
